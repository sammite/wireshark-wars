# wireshark-wars
source code for presentation at city college of Chicago


This is a series of very basic malware techniques presented in nim, 
which I will be using as examples in a wireshark lab that shows how to find these basic techniques.
Nothing shown here is at the level of sophistication that would provide useful tools for any real threat actors, 
but to appease my blue team friends, 
I will also include notes in each file for tips on how to detect these attacks nonetheless.
